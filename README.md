# NLP Semester Project
## Spam classification

## Group 12:
- Mehul Agarwal S20210010142
- Anushthan Saxena S20210010027

- This is an implementation of a spam classifier using NLP techniques
- All the files required have been zipped along with the code
- The code can be run in any jupyter notebook environment.
    - Note that the project requires **pandas, numpy** and **scikit_learn**
- run `pip install numpy pandas scikit_learn` in the terminal within this directory 

- Dataset has been provided in the form of a csv file, and there are 5171 emails with spam/ham classification
- The model is trained for 80% of the dataset, and then tested for the remaining 20%.
    - This can be changed in the code by changing the test_size value in the Baye's model  

- Change the start and end index to get a desired range of predictions printed, just to check the working of the model
